# GradesAlerter
 
### A java program that checks if new grades are available for any courses you're taking. 

`(Works for YorkU student)`

#### Motivation: 
Instructors can take upto 1 month after final exams to post the grades for courses. After a course in over, I used to wait in anticipation and check regularly if any lingering grades had been posted (upto 5 times everyday!). 

1. This program automatically checks your behalf. 
2. Alerts you when they're available. 
3. Automates the manual process of going to the registrar's page and sign-in to Passport York acc, etc. 

Since Yorku does not have any API, this program uses Selenium with a headless browser to do the computation in the background.
